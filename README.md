# Three.js + TS template

![image](image.png)
This is my template to quickly setup a TS + Three.js project so that I can mess around with shaders.

# How to use

### Clone the repository
```
gh repo clone Boom123bam/three-shader-template
```

### Install
```
npm i
```

### Run
```
npm run dev
```

Done! Now you can edit **vertex.frag** and **fragment.frag** to update the shader.
